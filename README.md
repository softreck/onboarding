## Employees


Softreck employees are productive and creative individuals. 
Softreck has a responsibility to safeguard our corporate interests, but 
we also value and respect the personal initiative of our employees. 
We hired you because we believe in you, your skills, and your value 
and we recognize you will have many opportunities to do and create cool things outside of your employment here. 
We support your independent efforts to build, and create, and contribute 
and we want to provide clear communication and guidelines about how to do so properly.
 e want to make sure that we set common expectations so that we are never in an adversarial position relative to our employees. The legal terms below flow from these objectives.
