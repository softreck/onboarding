## Collaboration beyond our teams

By tapping into the collective talent and innovation of open source communities, we believe we can helps fuel much of the technology we use today, from open source platforms like Linux and Cloud's open platforms to open source browsers like Firefox and Chromium.

The open community-to-enterprise development model often results in more secure software.

.. when everyone can access the code, threats can be discovered and patched more quickly. 

As an added level of security, Softreck tests, hardens, and supports open source software so each customer has the same level of assurance.


## Employees


Softreck employees are productive and creative individuals. 
Softreck has a responsibility to safeguard our corporate interests, but 
we also value and respect the personal initiative of our employees. 
We hired you because we believe in you, your skills, and your value 
and we recognize you will have many opportunities to do and create cool things outside of your employment here. 
We support your independent efforts to build, and create, and contribute 
and we want to provide clear communication and guidelines about how to do so properly.
 e want to make sure that we set common expectations so that we are never in an adversarial position relative to our employees. The legal terms below flow from these objectives.

### Using a trusted process

Through our unique development model, we start with community-created open source software and build upon each project to harden security, fix bugs, patch vulnerabilities, and add new features. 

An open development model connects Softreck engineers to open source communities. 
As members work together to identify and elevate the best ideas,
we support them by contributing to the code and creating products from upstream projects.


### Non-Code Works. Employees are encouraged to create non-executable copyrighted works, such as books, speeches, articles and publications, 
collectively "Non-Code Works" and can do so in their own name and with their own copyright, without any prior approval, subject to the following:

Notice Required for Compensated Works. You must provide notice to the Softreck IP Committee at least ten (10) business days prior to publishing any Non-Code Works 
for which you expect to receive compensation in any form from any third party. 
Softreck may, at its discretion, require you to forego any compensation for work done using Company Resources.

ii. Credit to the Company. You may state that you work for the Company in your background or biographical material. 
If you developed any part of the work using Company Resources, you may say that the Company sponsored the creation of the work provided 
that you do not represent the work as an official the Company publication.


## Stable and secure community

we’ve worked for more than 3 years to invest in open projects and technologies, protect and defend open source intellectual property, and recruit developers who actively participate in open projects across the IT stack.

This experience helps inform our development model to produce more stable and secure community.
